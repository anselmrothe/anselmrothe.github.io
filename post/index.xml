Learning sequential patterns from graphical programs 
A fundamental question in cognitive science is how people infer structured, rule-like mental representations (Fodor, 1975).
We are addressing this question by introducing an experimental paradigm called “Track-A-Mole”, in which participants predict the step-wise movements of a cartoon mole on a two-dimensional space.
The movements of the mole are generated by underlying graphical programs.
Figure 1: (PDF version) Graphical programs for sequential patterns The programs are built from a few meaningful building blocks, such as jump, which moves the mole along its current direction and turn, which changes its current direction.</description>
